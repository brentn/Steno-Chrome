no space after multistroke word
need to reset space suppression

is queue getting output??


=====================
Translator algorithm:
if (queue.isEmpty)
  translateSimpleStroke

else (queue not empty)
  lookup fullstroke
  if (found)
    result.undo_chars = queue.translation.length
    queue = lookup(fullstroke) + current state
    format queue
    result = queue
    if (not ambiguous)
      commit queue

  else (not found)
    commit queue
    translateSimpleStroke


translateSimpleStroke     
  queue = lookup(stroke) + current state
  if (found)
    format queue
  else (not found)
    queue = raw stroke
  result = queue;
  if (!found || !ambiguous)
    commit queue


Undo algorithm:
if (queue.isEmpty)
  undo 1 item from history into queue
remove one stroke from queue
backspace over the text
if queue is not empty
  push queue onto redo stack
get up to 2 more items from history 
  backspace over their translations
  and push onto the redo stack
replay the redo stack
